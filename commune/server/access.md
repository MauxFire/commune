Access to A Module






Whitelist/Blacklist Functions

If you want to restrict access to a module, you can use the whitelist and blacklist functions. These functions are used to restrict access to a module based on the user's role.

Only Admins can have access to all functions in a module and there is by default one admin per commune (computer). The admin can add other admins if needed.

Anyone who is not the admin can be assigned a role. They also must only call functions that are whitelisted for their role.

To add a user to a role, use the add_user function. For example, to add a user to the admin role:

```python
c.add_user("5DUdqShkPzzVDYGznZJQ92xP8cdp5BTt9XSrgMDMgHRArRyY", role="admin")
```

To add a user to a custom role:

```python
c.add_user("5DUdqShkPzzVDYGznZJQ92xP8cdp5BTt9XSrgMDMgHRArRyY", role="custom_role")
```


Default Whitelist Functions

The default whitelist functions are the functions from the Module class. These functions are available to all users by default.


Example

```python
import commune as c

class MyModule(c.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def my_function(self):
        print("Hello, World!")


c.print(MyModule.whitelist)
```
