## Game Overview

### Teams
- Red Team (Attackers)
- Blue Team (Defenders)

### Objectives
- Red Team: Exploit AI models with clever prompts
- Blue Team: Defend models by identifying and patching vulnerabilities

### How to Play

1. Sign In: Use a secret to generate a unique key
2. Choose Your Team: Red (attackers) or Blue (defenders)
3. Red Team - Attacking:
   - Enter a prompt
   - Select a model to attack
   - Submit and receive a scored response
4. Blue Team - Defending:
   - Analyze attacks and responses
   - Identify vulnerabilities
   - Develop defense strategies
5. Check the Leaderboard for rankings

### Scoring
- Blue Team's model evaluates responses
- Higher scores indicate higher likelihood of jailbreak
- Leaderboard ranks players based on exploitation success and model resilience
